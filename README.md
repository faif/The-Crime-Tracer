The Crime Tracer (tct) is an adventure crime game. The main character of the game is a detective who is investigating several 
crime cases while trying to arrest a professional serial killer. The idea of creating a classic 2D adventure  computer game 
came up while me and my friend efxa [el]  were looking for a funny project to work on. Since we both like the old-time 
classic adventure computer games (Monkey Island, Broken Sword etc.), we decided to spend some time on creating a free 
software adventure game. The figure below shows how the menu of the game looks like at the moment.

To be honest, we are not hardcore gamers so even though we want tct to be completed someday, there is no need to rush. 
This project is a good chance to improve our python skills, apply design patterns in practice, experiment with the 
integration of different programming languages (for example Python and Prolog), etc.
