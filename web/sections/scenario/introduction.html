       <p>It is Thursday evening. Jonathan is in his personal office, which is located in London, United Kingdom. It is Winter and the weather is extremely cold. Jonathan is enjoying his tea near the fireplace.</p>
       <p>Even though he is tired, he is reading about older unsolved cases. It is almost 10. Suddenly, the telephone rings. “Who is calling so late?”, John is wondering. It is a man with scared voice who is desperately asking for help.</p>
       <p>The man is the very popular and famous actor Maxuel Johnson. Maxuel, asks from Jonathan to investigate the murder of his wife, Jessica Johnson. Maxuel promises to give a great reward to Jonathan if he succeeds to arrest her killer.</p>
       <p>Jonathan is trying to calm him down and asks to meet him in a public place to have a discussion about the case; in this way, Jonathan will have the chance to collect as much information about the case as possible. They make an agreement to meet in “St Jame's Park” the day after.</p>
       <p>Although Jonathan was interrupted, he continues his work. Suddenly, the telephone rings for a second time; a male with a strange voice threatens Jonathan, telling him to drop the case, otherwise his life will be in danger.</p>
       <p>Jonathan realises that his personal office is tracked. He finds a tracer in his phone. He is very surprised and terrified. He stops reading about the old cases and starts to collect information about the case. He is in a magical way both fascinated and scared about this case. He is not worried about risking his life. He wants to investigate the case, because he thinks that it is a case of great importance.</p>
       <p>And the game starts...</p>
