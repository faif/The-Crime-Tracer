The Crime Tracer -- `TODO' starts here.

Todo:

  * Convert to MVC: credits.py, kezmenu.py, menu.py

  * At the moment all listeners are notified
    about all kinds of messages. This should
    not be the case; only the relevant listeners
    should be informed each time a new event is
    generated. 

  * The error messages should always be
    printed - regardless of the verbose flag

  * Informative messages should be printed
    only when the verbose flag is off

  * Some features described on the design document
    might be outdated (for example 1024x768 resolution,
    both keyboard and mouse support to control the 
    character). Other are too abstract and perhaps not 
    necessary (for example character's strengh and mood)

  * Use docstrings instead of doxygen, since they can be
    used for providing online documentation (for example
    through the interactive shell)

Questions that need discussion

  * I18N for messages?

  * Some methods are very long (refactor)?

  * Convert to MVC: anim_sprite.py?

The Crime Tracer -- `TODO' ends here.
